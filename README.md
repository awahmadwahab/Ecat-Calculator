This project is an Aggregate Calculator designed for students to calculate their admission aggregate scores based on matriculation, intermediate, and ECAT (Engineering College Admission Test) results.

## Features

- Calculates aggregate scores for three different groups based on user input.
- Provides results formatted to three decimal places for accuracy.
